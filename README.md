Machine Learning project on "**Developing a Predictive Model to Enhance Diabetes Diagnosis in Healthcare**".

**Course :** CS 403/603

**Step by step process to detect any person is with diabetes or not:**
01. Importing all the required python libraries and dataset.
02. Showing dataset values (to check what kind of values are there), shape of full dataset, and showing first/last five data samples from full dataset.
03. Showing dataset attributes/columns/features.
04. Showing attributes/columns/features basic info (like Null/Not-null, integer/float etc.).
05. Showing any Null values are present or not in the dataset. Cheking for all the attributes.
06. Showing full description of all attributes/columns/features (Optional).
07. Getting value counts for the target attribute variables i.e. how many classes are present in the target attribute.
08. Visualize distributions of features/attributes and correlation analysis between the features/attributes (Optional).
09. Differentiating the target data from overall dataset and creating two dataset (one dataset for all features and another for target class).
10. Splitting the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets (percentage is not fixed, we can change it).
11. Standardizing the features (Scaling in between 0 and 1) or add polynomial features with reduced degree.
12. Training through the different machine learning model.
13. Making predictions on the test set.
14. Evaluating the model (accuracy, precision and recall etc.).
15. Plotting the confusion matrix and evaluation matrices.
16. Checking the important features (Optional).
